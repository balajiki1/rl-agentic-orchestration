## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **reinforcement learning–driven orchestration system** for research agents.  
When a user submits a query, the system must choose between three possible workflows:

- **Fast Summary** (low cost, low depth)  
- **Deep Research** (high cost, high depth)  
- **RAG Retrieval** (balanced cost and depth)

The goal is to replace static heuristic decision rules with **learning-based agent orchestration** using:

1. **Q-Learning (value-based RL)**
2. **UCB1 Bandit (exploration-based RL)**

The system learns which workflow performs best for different types of queries.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

Workflow:

1. User query → state encoder  
2. State sent to RL controller (Q-Learning or UCB)  
3. Controller selects workflow  
4. Workflow agent returns answer + metadata  
5. Reward computed  
6. RL model updates policy  
7. System improves with experience
