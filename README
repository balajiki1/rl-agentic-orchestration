## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **reinforcement learning–driven orchestration system** for research agents.  
When a user submits a query, the system must choose between multiple research workflows:

- **Fast Summary** (low cost, lower depth)  
- **Deep Research** (high cost, high depth)  
- **RAG Retrieval** (balanced cost and depth)

Traditionally, systems use static heuristics.  
Here, I integrate **RL** to enable the system to *learn optimal workflow selection through experience*, improving both answer quality and tool efficiency.

This project implements two RL approaches:

1. **Q-Learning (Value-Based RL)**  
2. **UCB1 (Exploration-Based Bandit Algorithm)**

The system learns a policy that adapts based on query topic, complexity, and prior performance.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

**Pipeline Description:**

1. **User Query** enters the system.  
2. **State Encoder** extracts:
   - Topic category (Tech / Health / General)  
   - Query length bucket  
   - Previous success / failure  
3. **RL Controller (Q-Learning or UCB)** selects a workflow.  
4. **Workflow Agents** execute:
   - Fast Summary  
   - Deep Research  
   - RAG Retrieval  
5. Output quality + tool usage = **reward**  
6. Reward updates the RL controller → system improves over time.

## 🧠 Reinforcement Learning Methods

### **1️⃣ Q-Learning**
- 18 discrete states  
- 3 possible actions (workflows)  
- Epsilon-greedy exploration with decay  
- TD update rule:

\[
Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha[r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]
\]

### **2️⃣ UCB Bandit**
- State-agnostic  
- Strong exploration emphasis  
- Baseline for comparison  

\[
a_t = \arg\max_a \left[ \bar{X}_a + c\sqrt{\frac{\ln t}{n_a}} \right]
\]

## 🧪 Training Environment

A **synthetic research environment** simulates realistic outcomes:

- Each state has a *hidden best workflow*  
- Rewards sampled from normal distribution  
- Tool cost penalty included  

Reward function:

\[
R = 1.0 \times \text{quality} - 0.2 \times \text{tools used}
\]
